# ode-project
 Simple ODE project for Modeling & Sim class. 

There are a couple libraries you need to run this program. 

To start you need SciPy, Matplotlib, and Numpy. 

To install those go into your terminal and type: 

pip install scipy - press 'enter/return'

pip install numpy - press 'enter/return'

pip install matplotlib - press 'enter/return'

If you run into pip issues, then try using 'pip3' instead of 'pip'.

After that, you should be able to run your program.

With the terminal CD into the directory where the 'main.py' file is saved and then type: 

python3 main.py - and press 'enter/return'
